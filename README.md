<!-- MAIN IDEA -->
## Main idea
From a voice recording containing several voices and possibly music, we count the number of distinct speakers and the number of women and men who speak.


<!-- UTILISATION -->
## Utilisation
The work has been split in two parts. It can be executed by using ```rendu_final.ipynb```

Structure :
- ```Reconnaissance Femme_Homme```  allows the recognition of the speaker's gender from a voice recording with only one speaker and no music.

Data used : LibriSpeech

- ```Separation_speacker```  in a soundtrack, allows to delimit the speeches and generates as many audio files as there are speakers



### For optimal operation, the LibriSpeech database should be added to the folder "Recognition Woman_Man" in a folder named "LibriSpeech". The verification database of moviesoundclips.net program, should be added to the root of the repository, in a folder named "moviesoundclips.net_test".
